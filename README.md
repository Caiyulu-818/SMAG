# SMAG
Soil microbial dark matter mining based on genome-resolved metagenomics 

We constructed the SMAG from 3,463 soil metagenomes. If this repository is useful, please consider additionally citing the individual sources.

## SMAG catalog

Soil MAGs were assembled from 3,463 soil metagenomes from 9 different ecosystems across globe. all the MAGs were recovered for individual metagenomic assemblies using three different tools with default options: Metabat (Kang et al., 2019) (v2.12.1), MaxBin 98 (v2.2.6), CONCOCT 99 (v1.0.0), which all on the basis of tetranucleotide frequencies(TNF) and coverage information. The resulting MAGs were refined using the module ‘bin_refinement’ from metaWRAP 13 (v1.2.1).
